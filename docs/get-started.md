# Get Started

This guide walks you through exporting your AI conversation history and importing it into Cognition Vault.

## Step 1: Export Your Data

### ChatGPT
1. Go to **Settings** > **Data Controls**.
2. Click **Export Data** and confirm.
3. Download the ZIP from the email OpenAI sends you.

### Claude
1. Go to **Settings** > **Account**.
2. Find the **Export Data** section.
3. Click **Request Data Export**.
4. Download the ZIP when ready.

### Gemini
1. Go to [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com).
2. Deselect all products and check only **Gemini Apps** (within My Activity).
3. Create the export and download the resulting ZIP.

## Step 2: Import into Cognition Vault

1. Open Cognition Vault.
2. Click **"Import your AI history"** on the home screen.
3. Select your provider (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini).
4. Choose the ZIP file you downloaded.
5. Wait for the import to complete — you'll see a confirmation banner.

> **Tip**: You can import from multiple providers. All conversations are searchable together.

## Step 3: Search and Recall

1. Type any keyword into the search bar.
2. Results appear instantly — click any result to jump to the exact message.
3. Each result shows the provider (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini), conversation title, and date.

## Wipe and Re-import

If you need to start fresh:

1. Click **"How it works"** on the home screen.
2. Navigate to Step 3 ("Your Data, Your Control").
3. Click **"Wipe Vault Now"** — this permanently deletes all imported data.
4. You can re-import your original export files at any time.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Windows SmartScreen warning | This build is unsigned. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" if you verified the checksum. |
| Import fails with error | Ensure you're importing the original ZIP from your provider, not an extracted folder. |
| No search results after import | Try a broader keyword. Search uses exact word matching. |
| App won't launch | Ensure you're running Windows 10 or later (64-bit). |
